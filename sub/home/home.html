				<h2>About</h2>
				For the past 7 years I've been a freelance game/software programmer. But I've 
				decided to switch gears and stopped taking commisions. Instead I want to start 
				working on my own game/app ideas. <br>
				<br>
				During the past year I've been working on a 2D and 3D game rendering engine in 
				Java. This all started as a toy engine I wrote for myself for educational 
				purposes. I never expected it would be nearly efficient enough for serious use.
				It turns out the Java Virtual Machine is able to run my code perfectly fine at 
				a reasonable framerate. <br>
				<br>
				If people find my work useful and enjoyable, they are welcome to support me in 
				whatever way they see fit.
