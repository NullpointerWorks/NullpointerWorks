			</div>
			<p>For the majority of people who own a computer treat it as nothing more than a fancy box. A tool that 
			breaks often and is always a hassle to update or kept at reasonable speed. They use it to check their 
			e-mails, view and print documents, update their socials and perhaps play a game of solitair. However, in 
			the eyes of an enthusiast it's not just a fancy box, nor an over-powered calculator. It's a piece of 
			furnature that requires the same love and care like anything else in the household.</p>
			<p>In particular the gaming community is expressing this love in a way similar to the people tuning their 
			car's performance and looks. When you search online for water-cooled PCs you find images of hard-tubing 
			cooling systems with colorful coolant and lots of lighting and cable wiring matching the theme.</p>
			<p>Mind you I'm not a hardcore PC tuner, but I do enjoy tinkering when I have the oppertunity. One of those 
			opportunities had risen when I was building my new PC. It has plenty room for eight fans and since I
			had some multicolor fans laying around, I thought it be fun to have those installed. Unfortunately, the 
			orignal controller for these fans was lacking so I opted to create my own.</p>

			</div>
			<p>Reviewing my options I stumbled on a library available for the Arduino named "FastLED" that allows for 
			controller addressable LEDs. Good stuff, since the LEDs inside the multicolor fans are addressable red-green-blue(RGB) 
			LEDs. I'm not sure exactly which product series they used, but I suspect they are WS2812B. The WS2812 are a 
			popular choice in RGB strips and are consealed in a reasonably sized 5050 package. Having checked, the configuration
			inside the fan turns out to be a circularly glued LED strip.</p>
			<p>The Arduino development platform utilize AVR microcontroller(MCU for short) and among the most popular, 
			the mega328, has attained a large code base. Arduino has made development for these microcontrollers 
			very easy with their programming software (the Arduino IDE) and have made the MCU family quite popular. </p>
			<p>The FastLED library can allocate a pin for sending data over to an addressable LED. All other LEDs on 
			the strip have their data input daisy-chained together on the output of the previous. Only the first LED in 
			the chain needs to be informed on what behaviour the others are to display. So to control eight RGB fans 
			I need at least 8 digital pins, one for each LED strip. The mega328 has 10 digital I/O pins and 5 analog 
			pins that can be configured to be inputs, or digital outputs. Lastly, to signal the controller to step to 
			the next color pattern I need to ensure I don't allocate all my interrupt-capable pins as RGB data outputs. </p>
			<p>Finally, I want the controller to be easily installable inside a PC case. The 2.5-inch drive mounting 
			spots are very common nowadays, so I wanted the controller to be mountable in a free slot. In case the 
			controller can't be mounted anywhere it still need an enclosure to protect the circuitry.</p>
