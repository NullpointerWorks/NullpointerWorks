			<p>For the majority of people that own a computer treat it as nothing more than a fancy box. A tool that 
			breaks often and is always a hassle to update or kept up to speed. They use it to check their 
			e-mails, view and print documents, update their socials and perhaps play a game of solitair. However, in 
			the eyes of an enthusiast it's not just a fancy box, nor an over-powered calculator. It's a piece of 
			furnature that requires the same love and care like anything else in the household.</p>
			<p>In particular the gaming community is expressing this love in a way similar to the people tuning their 
			car's performance and looks. When you search online for water-cooled PCs you find images of hardline tube 
			cooling systems with colorful coolant and lots of lighting and wiring matching in color to fit the 
			theme.</p>
			<p>Mind you I'm not a hardcore PC tuner, but I do enjoy tinkering when I have the oppertunity. One of 
			those opportunities had risen when I was building my new PC. The new case has plenty of room for future 
			upgrades and eight fan mounting points. I had some multicolor fans laying around and I thought it would be 
			fun to have those installed. Unfortunately, the original controller for those fans was lacking so I opted 
			to make my own.</p>

			</div>
			<p>I'm not sure exactly which product series they used to produce the red, green and blue(RGB) lighting 
			effects, but I suspect they are WS2812B. The WS2812 are a popular choice in RGB strips and are consealed 
			in a reasonably sized package. Having checked, it turns out the fan's enclosure has a LED strip glued 
			inside to form a circle.</p>
			
			<img onclick="openURL('img/argb_fan_open.jpg');" style="cursor: zoom-in;" class="image_pane" src="img/argb_fan_open.jpg"></img>
			<div class="image_desc">Translucent cover removed exposing the LED strip.</div>
			
			<p>These types of LEDs are also referred to as addressable-RGB. A device sends data to it and the circuitry 
			inside the LED manages the color output. All you need is 5 volts of power and a data line.</p>
			
			<p>Reviewing my options I stumbled on a library available for the Arduino named "FastLED" that allows for 
			controlling addressable LEDs. All other LEDs on the strip have their data input daisy-chained together on the output 
			of the previous. Only the first LED in the chain needs to be informed on what behaviour the others are 
			to display. So to control eight RGB fans I need eight digital pins, one for each LED strip. The Mega328 has 
			10 digital I/O pins and 5 analog pins that can be configured to be inputs, or digital outputs. I need to 
			ensure to keep at least one interrupt-capable pin as an input to signal the controller to step to the next pattern.</p>
			
			<p>To really complete this project I need an enclosure to protect the circuitry. Since 2.5 inch drive 
			mounting points are very common nowadays it would be nice if the controller can be mounted in an open slot. 
			But that's completely optional. I own a 3D-printer so I can print the enclosure right 
			here at my workshop.</p>
			
			<!-- drawing the schematic -->
			<div class="chapter">
				<a id="schema" href="#schema"><img style="width: 20px;" src="img/star.svg" /></a>Schematics
			</div>
			<p>In the schematic below I've drawn an AMP connector to supply the controller with power. The vast majority of 
			power supplies will have such a connector available. The reverse polarity protection is optional, but 
			I've added it in for good measure. You could opt for a SATA power connector instead if you feel like 
			leaving AMP in a museum. </p>
			<img onclick="openURL('img/schem/Supply.png');" style="cursor: zoom-in;" class="image_pane" src="img/schem/Supply.png"></img>
			<div class="image_desc">ATX Power supply to the controller.</div>
			
			<p>Next up is the USB connection. I want to be able to upload code to the device with as much ease as 
			possible. This is accomplished using an FT232 integrated circuit (IC). It translates the USB communication 
			protocol to UART which the microcontroller understands. I've added two LEDs to indicate when 
			communication is happening. These are available on pin 22 and 23 by default on a fresh FT232 IC. The 
			USB lines have SP1003 transient suppression diodes to help protect against electrostatic discharge events. 
			This could be, for example, someone touching the bare circuit board while not properly grounded or a power 
			spike from the power supply unit. The RX, TX and DTR(Data Terminal Ready) signal lines will go to the 
			microcontroller.</p>
			<img onclick="openURL('img/schem/UART.png');" style="cursor: zoom-in;" class="image_pane" src="img/schem/UART.png"></img>
			<div class="image_desc">USB input to UART conversion.</div>
			
			<p>Hooking up the microcontroller is pretty straight forward. The RX, TX and DTR will go to pin 1, 2 and 3 
			of the Mega328. Remember to swap the RX and TX lines between the two IC's. When someone is transmitting(TX) 
			the other is recieving(RX), and visa versa. Pin 12 through 19 will serve as data lines for the ARGB strips. 
			Pin 4 is an interrupt-capable pin which I'll hook up to a switch. You could hook up the switch directly, but
			I really recommend using a debouncing circuit.</p>

			<div class="image_desc">Microcontroller circuitry with switch debouncing.</div>
			
			<p>The data lines from the Mega328 will each branch off to a 3-pin header. Two of those pins are for power 
			and ground bypassed with a capacitor to reduce some noise.</p>

			<p>Lastly, the fans get their 12 volts directly from the PC's power supply unit. We're not going to track or 
			modify the fan's speed. The fans are an inductive load so I added flyback diodes to protect against voltage 
			spikes. </p>

			</div>
			
			<p>The only through-hole(TH) components on the PCB are headers and the Mega328, everything else are surface-mounted 
			devices(SMD). I decided on TH instead of SMD for the microcontroller to make maintenance easier. This 
			version does not have an in-system programming(ISP) interface so you can't burn a bootloader into the 
			microcontroller directly. I may add this in future revisions. The location of the Mega328 will be populated 
			by a 28-pin insertion socket. </p>

			<div class="image_desc">PCB top layer.</div>
			
			<p>To isolate the 12V and 5V section I made sure the fans and ARGB header have their own copper planes on the 
			PCB. The the common powerlines seperate as well, so it's the responsibility of the power supply unit to manage 
			the power output. The four large non-plated drill holes are the mounting holes that should match the dimensions 
			of a 2.5-inch drive. </p>
			
			<p>The bottom layer is simple enough. There are no components placed and is just for soldering the TH components.</p>

			<p>I'll not be etching the PCB myself but outsource it to <a href="https://aisler.net" target="_blank">Aisler</a> 
			instead. They have a factory situated in Germany which is convenient for me living in the Netherlands. Note 
			that I'm not affiliated with Aisler. Though I only need one, the minimum batch size is three and just about a week 
			or so later the PCBs arrive. </p>

			</div>
			
			<p>The base of the enclosure is simple. It has screw holes that can be accessed from the bottom and screwed 
			to the top. The four offsets are to make sure the through-hole components don't press onto the material. The height of 
			offsets is about 1.6mm below the edge to take the PCB thickness in account.</p>

			<div class="image_desc">The enclosure bottom.</div>
			
			<p>The top of the enclosure is a bit more involved. Two large slots are present to allow for the power and RGB data 
			connector to be installed on the controller. The small hole in between is used for a switch to swap RGB pattern. You 
			could use the PC's reset switch to make the button convenient to locate. The two cutouts on the side of the enclosure 
			is where the power cable and USB connector are present.</p>

			<p>Lets begin with driving the ARGB fans. Installing the FastLED library can be done through the Library 
			Manager in the Arduino IDE, but can also be manually installed. </p>
			
			<p>The code below demonstrates how RGB data is sent to the LED strip. Using the addLeds() method I set
			the LED type to "NeoPixel" which is usually WS2812, data output set to "8" which is Arduino's D8 pin, and
			the amount of LEDs in the chain to 1.</p>
			<div class="codeblock">

{
	int red = 255;
	int green = 255;
	int blue = 255;
	
	CRGB* rgb = new CRGB();
	rgb->setRGB(red, green, blue);
	FastLED.addLeds&lt;NEOPIXEL, 8&gt;(rgb, 1);
}

void loop()
{
	// modify behavior here ...

			<p>The interrupt-capable pin we reserved for swapping the pattern needs to be attached to a function. When 
			the iterrupt pin gets triggered it halts all execution and runs the linked code. After the function returns, 
			execution resumes from where it left off.</p>

			<p>The interrupt will be triggered on the falling-edge of the input signal. This means that as soon as the 
			input goes from 5V to 0V, the interrupt code gets executed. </p>
			
			<p>During operation multiple fan controllers will need access to the same color palette. The state of the
